# BetBot - A Discord Betting Bot

BetBot is a feature-rich Discord bot that allows users to place bets on custom contests, manage their virtual currency, and interact with live betting rounds.

## Features

-   **Custom Betting Rounds**: Admins can open betting rounds between two contestants.
-   **Flexible Betting**: Users can place bets using commands (`!bet <contestant> <amount>`) or by reacting to live messages.
-   **Live Updates**: Betting messages update in real-time to show current bets, total pot, and timer status.
-   **Economy System**: Users have a virtual balance that is updated based on betting outcomes.
-   **Admin Controls**: Commands for managing betting rounds, setting channels, toggling timers, and adjusting user balances.
-   **Detailed Results**: Final betting results display winners, total pot, individual bets, and winnings.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get your BetBot up and running:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ClickSentinel/betbot.git
cd betbot
```

### 2. Create a Discord Bot Application

1.  Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2.  Click "New Application" and give your bot a name.
3.  Navigate to the "Bot" tab, click "Add Bot," and confirm.
4.  **Crucially, enable all three "Privileged Gateway Intents" (PRESENCE INTENT, SERVER MEMBERS INTENT, MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT) under the "Privileged Gateway Intents" section.**
5.  Copy your bot's token. You will need this in the next step.

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `betbot` directory (the same directory as `bot.py`) and add your bot token:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
```

Replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE` with the token you copied from the Discord Developer Portal.

### 4. Install Dependencies

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv venv
./venv/Scripts/activate # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate # On macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Bot

```bash
python bot.py
```

The bot should now be online in your Discord server.
