# Bot Issues Fix Documentation

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Type Checking Issues in Tests ✅
**Problem**: Test files had type checking errors with `dict` vs `Data` type mismatches.
**Solution**: Added proper type casting using `cast(Data, {})` for empty data structures in tests.
**Files affected**: `tests/test_live_message.py`

### 2. Betting Timer Mock Interference ✅
**Problem**: The betting timer was encountering mock objects from tests, causing runtime errors.
**Solution**: 
- Added direct import of `time` module in timer to avoid mock interference
- Added error handling cleanup to prevent stuck timer states
- Added automatic cleanup of stale timer state on bot startup

**Files affected**: 
- `utils/betting_timer.py`
- `bot.py`

### 3. Cleanup of Duplicate Test Files ✅
**Problem**: Duplicate test files with import errors were causing confusion.
**Solution**: Removed obsolete test files with incorrect imports.
**Files affected**: Removed `tests/test_live_message_fixed.py`

### 4. Enhanced Error Recovery ✅
**Problem**: Timer errors could leave the bot in an inconsistent state.
**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive error handling in timer
- Added automatic state cleanup on bot startup
- Created utility script for manual fixes

**Files created**: `fix_bot_issues.py`
