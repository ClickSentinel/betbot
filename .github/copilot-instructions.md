# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Discord Bot

This document provides essential guidelines for AI coding agents working on this Discord bot codebase.

## 1. Architecture Overview

The bot is built using `discord.py` and follows a cog-based architecture.
- **`bot.py`**: The main entry point, responsible for initializing the bot and loading cogs.
- **`cogs/`**: Contains modular components (cogs) that encapsulate related commands and event listeners. Each cog is a Python class inheriting from `commands.Cog`.
- **`data_manager.py`**: Handles loading and saving of persistent data (e.g., user balances, betting state) to `data.json`.
- **`config.py`**: Stores configuration variables, including Discord token, emojis, and various message strings.
- **`utils/`**: Contains utility functions, such as `live_message.py` for managing live-updating Discord messages.

## 2. Data Flow and Persistence

- **`data.json`**: All persistent data is stored in this JSON file.
- **`data_manager.py`**: Provides `load_data()` and `save_data()` functions to interact with `data.json`.
- **Data Structure**: The `data.json` typically contains keys like `balances`, `betting`, and `settings`.
  - `balances`: Stores user coin balances.
  - `betting`: Manages the state of active betting rounds (open, locked, bets, contestants).
  - `settings`: Stores bot-specific settings like `enable_bet_timer` and `bet_channel_id`.

**Convention**: Always use `data_manager.load_data()` to retrieve the current state and `data_manager.save_data()` to persist any changes. Avoid direct manipulation of `data.json`.

## 3. Key Components and Conventions

### Cogs
- Each cog should be a class inheriting from `commands.Cog`.
- Commands are defined using the `@commands.command` decorator.
- Helper methods within cogs often start with `_` (e.g., `_send_embed`, `_lock_bets_internal`).

### Live Messages
- The `utils/live_message.py` module is crucial for managing messages that update dynamically in Discord.
- Functions like `update_live_message`, `set_live_message_info`, `get_live_message_info` are used to interact with these messages.
- When updating betting state, ensure `update_live_message` is called to reflect changes in the live embed.

### Error Handling and Embeds
- The bot uses `discord.Embed` for consistent messaging.
- `_send_embed(ctx, title, description, color)` is a common helper for sending formatted messages.
- Various `COLOR_` constants (e.g., `COLOR_ERROR`, `COLOR_SUCCESS`) are defined in `config.py` for consistent styling.

## 4. General Bot Interaction Guidelines
- **Avoid Direct Messages**: The bot should never directly message a user. All communication should occur within server channels.

## 5. Critical Workflows

### Betting Round Lifecycle
1. **`!openbet <name1> <name2>`**: Initiates a new betting round. Sets `betting["open"] = True`.
2. **`!bet <amount> <choice>`**: Users place bets. Updates `data["betting"]["bets"]` and `data["balances"]`. If no betting round is open, the bot will respond with `TITLE_NO_OPEN_BETTING_ROUND` and `MSG_NO_ACTIVE_BET`. If no betting round is open and arguments are missing or invalid, the bot will respond with `TITLE_NO_OPEN_BETTING_ROUND` and `MSG_NO_ACTIVE_BET_AND_MISSING_ARGS`. If a betting round is open but arguments are missing or invalid, the bot will respond with `TITLE_INVALID_BET_FORMAT` and `MSG_INVALID_BET_FORMAT`.
3. **`!lockbets` or Timer Expiry**: Locks the betting round. Sets `betting["open"] = False` and `betting["locked"] = True`. Reactions are cleared from live messages.
4. **`!declarewinner <winner_name>` or `!closebet <winner_name>`**: Declares a winner, distributes winnings, and resets the betting state.

### Timer Management
- The `_run_bet_timer` task in `betting.py` handles automatic bet locking.
- `_cancel_bet_timer` is used to stop the timer.
- `togglebettimer` command enables/disables the timer.

### Reaction Betting Workflow
1.  **`!openbet <name1> <name2>`**: Initiates a new betting round and sends a "live betting message."
2.  **Bot adds reactions**: The bot adds predefined betting emojis (from `config.py`'s `C1_EMOJIS` and `C2_EMOJIS`) to the live message using `_add_betting_reactions`.
3.  **User reacts**: A user reacts to the live message with a betting emoji.
4.  **`on_raw_reaction_add` listener**: An event listener (expected in `bot.py` or a dedicated cog) detects the reaction.
5.  **Process reaction (Adding/Changing Bet)**:
    -   Verifies the reaction is on the active live message.
    -   Identifies the user and emoji.
    -   Uses `_get_contestant_from_emoji` to determine the chosen contestant.
    -   Retrieves the bet amount from `REACTION_BET_AMOUNTS` (in `config.py`).
    -   Checks user balance.
    -   **If the user already has an active reaction bet for this round:**
        -   The previous bet amount is refunded to their balance.
        -   The bot removes the *previous reaction emoji* from the live message.
    -   Deducts the new bet amount, records the new bet in `data.json` (including the emoji used).
    -   The user's *new reaction* remains on the live message, indicating their active bet.
    -   Calls `update_live_message` to refresh the live embed with updated bet totals. **No separate messages should be sent to the user for placing a reaction bet.**
6.  **`on_raw_reaction_remove` listener**: An event listener detects when a user removes a reaction.
7.  **Process reaction (Unbetting)**:
    -   Verifies the reaction is on the active live message and corresponds to an active bet by the user.
    -   Refunds the bet amount to the user's balance.
    -   Removes the bet from `data.json`.
    -   Calls `update_live_message` to refresh the live embed. **No separate messages should be sent to the user for removing a reaction bet.**

**Important Notes:**
-   Users can see their active bet reaction on the live message.
-   All user betting reactions are cleared from the live message when the betting round is locked (`!lockbets` or timer expiry).

**Troubleshooting Reaction Bets:**
-   The most common issue is a missing or incorrectly implemented `on_raw_reaction_add` or `on_raw_reaction_remove` event listener, or they are not properly registered with the bot.

## 5. External Dependencies

- `discord.py`: The primary library for Discord bot interaction.
- No other significant external dependencies beyond standard Python libraries are used.

## 6. Project Structure
- `betbot/`: Main application directory.
- `betbot/cogs/`: Discord cogs.
- `betbot/utils/`: Utility functions.
- `connection.txt`: Contains the bot token (not committed to Git).

## 7. Development Environment
- Python 3.8+ is required.
- Dependencies are managed via `pip`. A `requirements.txt` file should be created if not present, listing `discord.py`.

### Live Message Final Results
- When a winner is declared, the live message should be updated to clearly show:
    - The winning contestant.
    - The total pot amount.
    - The amount bet by each user.
    - How much each winning user gained.

## 6. Messaging Conventions

To maintain a consistent user experience, adhere to the following messaging guidelines:

### General Principles
- **Use Embeds for All User-Facing Messages**: All messages sent to Discord channels should be `discord.Embed` objects for consistent styling and readability.
- **Centralize Messages in `config.py`**: All static message strings and embed titles should be defined as constants in `config.py`. Avoid hardcoding messages directly in cog files.
- **Consistent Emojis**: Use predefined emojis (e.g., `‚úÖ`, `‚ùå`, `‚ö†Ô∏è`, `üîí`, `üèÜ`, `üí∏`) from `config.py` at the beginning of titles or descriptions to convey status or intent quickly.
- **Markdown for Emphasis**: Use Markdown consistently for bolding (`**text**`) and inline code (` `code` `) within embed descriptions.
- **F-strings for Dynamic Content**: Utilize f-strings for inserting dynamic data into message strings.

### Message Formatting Examples (from `config.py`)

```python
# Example General Message
MSG_AMOUNT_POSITIVE = "Amount must be a positive number."
MSG_INVALID_BET_FORMAT = "**Invalid bet format.**\nUse `!bet <contestant> <amount>` or `!bet <amount> <contestant>`.\nExample: `!bet Alice 100`"

# Example Betting Specific Message
MSG_BET_ALREADY_OPEN = "‚ö†Ô∏è A betting round is already open!"
MSG_BETTING_LOCKED_SUMMARY = "Betting is now locked! No more bets can be placed. A winner will be declared soon."

# Example Live Bet Initial Description (multi-line f-string)
MSG_LIVE_BET_INITIAL_DESCRIPTION = (
    "**Contestants:**\n> {contestant1_emoji} **{name1}**\n> {contestant2_emoji} **{name2}**\n\n"
    "No bets yet.\n"
    "**Total Pot:** `0 coins`\n\n"
    f"{MSG_PLACE_MANUAL_BET_INSTRUCTIONS}"
)
MSG_NO_BETS_PLACED_YET = "No bets placed yet."
MSG_NO_ACTIVE_BET_AND_MISSING_ARGS = "‚ö†Ô∏è There is no active betting round. When one is started, use `!bet <amount> <choice>` to place your bet."
MSG_BET_CHANGED = "üîÑ <@{user_id}>, your bet of `{amount}` coins has been changed from **{old_contestant}** to **{new_contestant}**!"

# Example Embed Titles
TITLE_BETTING_ERROR = "‚ùå Betting Error"
TITLE_BET_PLACED = "‚úÖ Bet Placed"
TITLE_POT_LOST = "üí∏ Pot Lost!"
TITLE_COINS_TAKEN = "‚úÖ Coins Taken"
TITLE_NO_OPEN_BETTING_ROUND = "‚ö†Ô∏è No Open Betting Round"
```

### Guidelines for New Messages
- When creating new user-facing messages, always define them as constants in `config.py`.
- Follow the existing patterns for emoji usage, Markdown, and f-string interpolation.
- Ensure new messages are concise and clearly convey information to the user.
