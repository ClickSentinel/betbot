ARCHIVED: Complex integration tests for reaction betting.

These tests were created to validate the full reaction betting workflow,
but proved too complex to maintain due to extensive mocking requirements.

The core functionality they were trying to test is covered by:
- test_race_condition_fix.py (race condition prevention)
- test_betting.py (core betting logic)
- test_bet_state.py (state management)

Keep this file for reference of testing patterns and potential future use
when a better integration testing approach is developed.
