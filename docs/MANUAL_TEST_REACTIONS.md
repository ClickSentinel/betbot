# Manual Test: Reaction Batching Fix

## Problem Fixed
- **Before**: Clicking reaction emojis would cause them to disappear immediately
- **After**: The final clicked emoji should remain visible as your active bet

## Test Steps

1. **Start the bot**: `python bot.py`

2. **Open a betting round**: `!openbet Alice Bob`

3. **Test single reaction** (should work correctly):
   - Click 🔥 (100 coins on Alice)
   - ✅ **Expected**: 🔥 should stay visible
   - ✅ **Expected**: Your bet should be placed for Alice, 100 coins

4. **Test rapid multiple reactions** (this was the broken part):
   - Click 🔥 quickly
   - Then click ⚡ quickly  
   - Then click 💪 quickly
   - Then click 🌟 quickly (switches to Bob)
   - ✅ **Expected**: Only 🌟 should remain visible after ~1 second
   - ✅ **Expected**: Your bet should be for Bob, 100 coins (not Alice)
   - ✅ **Expected**: No emoji flickering or disappearing

5. **Test reaction removal** (manual bet cancellation):
   - Click the emoji you have active
   - Click it again to remove it
   - ✅ **Expected**: Emoji disappears and bet is cancelled with refund

6. **Test insufficient balance**:
   - Use `!setbal @yourself 50` to set low balance
   - Try clicking 🏆 (1000 coins)
   - ✅ **Expected**: Emoji disappears immediately with error message

## Key Improvements

- **No more emoji flickering**: Final reaction stays visible
- **Clean visual feedback**: Old reactions disappear, final one remains
- **Batched processing**: Multiple rapid clicks only result in final selection
- **Proper error handling**: Clear feedback for insufficient funds

## Technical Details

The fix changed the reaction processing from:
```python
# OLD (broken): Remove ALL reactions, then add final one back
await self._remove_user_betting_reactions(message, user, data, exclude_emoji=None)
await message.add_reaction(final_emoji)  # This caused flickering
```

To:
```python  
# NEW (fixed): Remove all OTHER reactions, keep final one
await self._remove_user_betting_reactions(message, user, data, exclude_emoji=final_emoji)
# Final emoji is already there from Discord, so we just exclude it from removal
```

This eliminates the remove→add cycle that caused the flickering behavior.
