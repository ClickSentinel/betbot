## üÜï New Features

### Multi-Session Betting (October 5, 2025)

- **Per-session live messages**: each betting session can now have its own live message (embed) and channel, allowing multiple independent rounds to run in parallel without visual or state interference.
- **Numeric session IDs**: sessions are identified by small integer IDs (1, 2, 3, ...). This simplifies user/admin references (`!openbet 2`, `!lock 2`) and makes command parsing predictable.
- **Per-session timers**: timers (auto-close and countdown display) are stored per-session and reflected in each live message independently. Timer configuration supports auto-close timestamps and human-friendly countdown footers.
- **Unified lock/close commands**: `!lock`, `!close`, and other moderation commands accept an optional session id. When omitted, behavior falls back to the legacy single-session mode for compatibility.
- **Canonical bet storage + accessor layer**: to avoid divergent state between manual `!bet` and reaction-based bets, a thin accessor layer was added in `betbot/data_manager.py`:
  - `get_bets(data, session_id=None)`
  - `set_bet(data, session_id, user_id, bet_info)`
  - `remove_bet(data, session_id, user_id)`
  These functions provide a single API so all code paths read/write the same canonical storage (session-aware when applicable).
- **Reaction handlers made session-aware**: reaction add/remove flows now resolve whether the reacted message is a session-specific live message and include `session_id` in pending reaction entries. This ensures that reaction bets and manual `!bet` operations converge on the same session data.
- **Live-message update suppression**: the live-message batcher was hardened so the final lock/winner state isn't overwritten by queued updates; updates targeted at a session will not clear a final winner embed.
- **Backward compatibility & migration**: legacy single-session behavior is preserved. Accessors map calls to the legacy `data["betting"]` when `session_id` is omitted. A migration path is recommended for converting an existing single `betting` object into a session if you want to opt-in to multi-session mode.
- **Commands and UX changes** (high level):
  - `!openbet [session_id] [title]` ‚Äî open a new session or open under a specific numeric id
  - `!lock [session_id]` / `!close [session_id]` ‚Äî lock or close a session (numeric id optional)
  - `!mybet [session_id?]` ‚Äî report a user's bets for the specified session or legacy session when omitted
  - `!bettinginfo [session_id?]` ‚Äî show session-specific summary and timer data

- **Tests & validation**: new unit and integration tests were added:
  - `tests/test_accessors.py` ‚Äî accessor behavior (get/set/remove)
  - `tests/test_process_bet_session.py` ‚Äî ensures `_process_bet` writes to session storage and updates balances correctly
  These tests were used to validate the accessor + session refactors; the test-suite run passed locally (166 passed, 0 failed) after iterative fixes.

- **Developer notes / next steps**:
  - Implement a `SessionBetState` thin wrapper to allow existing `BetState` refund/balance logic to operate against a session dict (planned next step).
  - Refactor reporting commands (`!mybet`, `!bettinginfo`, `!debug`) to fully enumerate sessions and present per-session summaries by default.
  - Update `betting_timer.py` to iterate active sessions and schedule per-session updates (recommended follow-up).

This multi-session feature substantially improves flexibility for running parallel matches, tournaments, or separate betting channels while maintaining compatibility with existing single-session workflows.

### Advanced Reaction Batching System
- **Smart Multi-Reaction Handling**: When users rapidly click multiple reaction emojis, the system intelligently batches these with a 1-second delay
- **Final Selection Processing**: Only the last reaction is processed, preventing bet conflicts
- **Clean Visual Feedback**: All previous reactions are automatically removed, showing only the user's final choice
- **Cross-Contestant Support**: Works seamlessly when switching between different contestants (e.g., üî• ‚Üí üåü ‚Üí üí™ ‚Üí üëë)
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Eliminates conflicts from rapid user interactions

### Robust Backup Processing System
- **Dual-Timer Architecture**: Primary 1-second timer with 3-second backup failsafe ensures bets are ALWAYS processed
- **Failure Recovery**: Backup system activates when primary timer fails or is cancelled unexpectedly
- **Smart State Detection**: Backup only processes if primary timer didn't complete, preventing double-processing
- **Timer Cancellation Handling**: Improved error handling for timer cancellation edge cases
- **Production Reliability**: Ensures reaction bets never get stuck in pending state

### Comprehensive Debug Logging System
- **Dedicated Log Files**: `logs/reaction_debug.log` captures complete reaction processing flow
- **Structured Logging**: Timestamped entries with clear prefixes (üîç REACTION ADD, üîç PRIMARY TIMER, etc.)
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live debugging of reaction batching behavior
- **Performance Analysis**: Detailed timing and sequence tracking for optimization
- **Troubleshooting Support**: Complete audit trail for diagnosing edge cases

### Enhanced Error Handling & User Experience
- **Contradictory Output Fix**: Resolved bug where bot showed "Round Complete" with statistics but also "No bets were placed"
- **Clear No-Bets Messaging**: When no bets exist, shows "No bets were placed in this round. [Winner] wins by default!"
- **Consistent State Management**: Fixed logic flow where statistics were calculated before bet clearing but summary after
